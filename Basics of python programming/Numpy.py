#Array defination - 
# Array can store value of different data types.

lst = [1,2,3,4,5] #1 dimensional array
lst1= [[1,2,3]]   #2 dimensional array
lst2 =  [[[1,2,3,4,5]]] #3 dimensional array

# Rasterization -

# Turning on the pixel at a  specific intensity is called rasterization.
# Computer only understands 0 and 1 so they are true and false. So basically if we touch the screen then the pixel is on and if we don't touch it then the pixel is off and off is 0 and on is 1.
# So the computer will understand that the pixel is on or off. So this is called rasterization. This process is essential for rendering images on the screen.


# Numpy is a powerful library in Python that provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. It is widely used in data science, machine learning, and scientific computing due to its efficiency and ease of use.

# The numpy is a vectorized form of Array that consumes less memory and less computational cost.
